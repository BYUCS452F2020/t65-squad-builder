# T-65 Squad Builder

The T-65 Squad Builder is a squad builder and inventory management system for FantasyFlight Games' X-Wing 2.0 tabletop miniatures game. While there are many squad builders for X-Wing available, there are not very many that incorporate an inventory system in the squad builder.

## Team
I am looking for one other developer to join the team. UI experience preferred (but not required).

## Relational Database
We will use a MySQL implementation on the backend. The project will create 5 tables, a user account table, an inventory table, a squad table, a ship table, and an upgrade table. We might condense the tables down a bit or limit features depending on time constraints.

## NoSQL Database
We will use MongoDB for our NoSQL implementation.

## Business
This will be an open source project. It is to be treated as a proof of concept project, as we will not be addressing proper authentication security, etc. It's just to cut our teeth on database design and interactions, and how they integrate into a backend stack with a front end interface.

## Legal
As an open source project offered free of charge no specific licensing is required. All attributions will be made to FantasyFlight Games, Lucasfilms ltd, and Disney.

## Technical
The backend will be created using Java utilizing the Spring framework. The front end stack is TBD.
